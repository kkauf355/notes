Winston, log4js, bunyan are logging libraries.

The act of persisting the log is called:

-   Winston: Transports
-   Bunyan: Streams
-   Log4js: Appenders

In Winston 3, a "transport" is a storage device for your logs, a writable stream i.e. carrying the data from the app to the console or file.

**Don't go crazy with logging. Use it to know what came in and out of the system. You can figure out almost everything with those two.**
