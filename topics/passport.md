# Install

when using passport, I also needed to use:
passport-local: lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js applications
expess-session: an HTTP server-side framework used to create and manage a session middleware
connect-mongo: i needed to use v3 to get MongoStore to work
mongodb: required for connect-mongo
```bash
npm install passport
npm install passport-local
npm install express-session
npm install connect-mongo
npm install mongodb
```
