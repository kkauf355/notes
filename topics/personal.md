# Who Am I
I'm Kevin. I love the truth, and knowing how things works. I like to be where I can provide the most value.

What it would take to make a switch from automation engineer to web dev software engineer. I'm trying to figure out how far away I am from being employable.

### Personal
I started learning web dev as a hobby. I want to create an app that I can keep track of workouts for my wife and myself. The dream is to release it publicly one day.

The ease in which I could get started with VS Code, the power of Git and version control, professional code standards, a community with so much information made public for learning, were all extremely compelling and totally unlike everything in the industrial controls/automation world. 

### Professional
I've been an automation engineer for over 10 years, programming HMIs and PLCs (programmable logic controllers) (embedded systems). I've worked on fairly complex processes and applications for the pharmaceutical and food industry (batching systems, recipe systems, inventory management systems). HMIs are always custom scripting languages (c++ ish) or VB. I've written a lot of basic SQL queries and stored procedures, debugged stored procedures and jobs. 

I've worked in pharma, food, and automotive:
 Pharma: highly regulated with strict testing (by hand) on every change integrating a ton of data
 Food: high speed long hours change code in production, only critical data matters bakery industry
 Automotive: fast and messy with a lot of data.

# Responsibilities

### EZSoft

Worked independently on medium size projects
  I was given a scope of work and a contact to the customer. I was able to manage the entire project, calling meetings when I was missing information that someone else had, develop the front end SCADA, and back end PLC / DB. worked on improving existing batch manager, recipe manager, control builder.

# Behavioral 
Greatest Strengths
self aware
reliable
logical

Greatest Weakness

# Examples that need to be organized 
do you want to teach someone how to engineer for 10 years
or teach someone JavaScript for 6-12 months

do you want someone who understands engineering who you have to teach a language
or want someone who understands programming but you have to teach to be an engineer
i've managed other people on small projects,

troubleshooting, debugging, breaking large projects into very granular pieces
Provided on call emergency customer support for bakery and pharma. Troubleshooting bugs, potentially making changes in prod.
i've interfaced with SQL
